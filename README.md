The practice problems I've used to practice this "season."

EDIT: I decided to stop practicing competitive programming problems to instead focus my time on learning about numerical analysis in python.
I think the change was a good choice, considering that the nature of what I want to do (research in data analytics and or operations research) doesn't focus on speedy algorithm implementation but slowly and developed developed analysis.
